# DiffGAN: GAN-Inspired Trajectory Generation by Inverse Reinforcement Learning-Informed Diffusion

We propose DiffGAN, a novel GAN-like IRL-informed
diffusion framework that employs a DM as the generator and MaxEnt IRL as the discriminator. Through closed loop optimization, this framework generates multimodal and human-like driving behaviors, effectively combining the human-likeness advantages of discriminative learning with the diversity capabilities of generative learning.
