# Configuration File Setup
Before training or inference, please make sure that the parameters in the config file are correct. Our parameter system uses JSON files, and the parameters and their meanings are as follows:

- `policy_ckpt_dir`: The directory where the diffusion model checkpoint is stored.
- `policy_ckpt_key`: The checkpoint key of the diffusion model.
- `feature_names`: Features used in reward function.
- `scene_location`: `boston` or `singapore`.
- `pkl_label`: To distinguish different training models, the checkpoint files are named as `adversarial_irl_results_<scene_location>_<pkl_label>`. The `pkl_label` of the checkpoint we provided is `"best"`。
- `num_scenes_to_evaluate`: The number of scenarios used for training.
- `num_scenes_to_infer`: The number of scenarios used for inference.
- `num_rollouts`: The number of rollouts generated by DM for each scenario.
- `learning_rate`: The learning rate in discriminator.
- `use_wandb`: `true` or `false`.
- `wandb_entity`: Your wandb username/team.
